# Agriculture Domain Contract

Canonical policy shared by **`agri-research`**, **`agri-deep-research`**,
**`agri-paper`**, **`agri-review`**, and **`agri-pipeline`**. Each of those skills
**delegates its machinery to the corresponding `food-*` skill** and applies this
contract on top. Read this file first; it is what makes the agri skills agricultural.

## 1. The delegation rule
The `agri-*` skills add **no new machinery**. Run the corresponding `food-*` skill's
workflow, subagents, gates, modes, and output contracts **exactly as written**:

| Skill | Delegates to |
|---|---|
| `agri-research` | `food-research` |
| `agri-deep-research` | `food-deep-research` |
| `agri-paper` | `food-paper` |
| `agri-review` | `food-review` |
| `agri-pipeline` | `food-pipeline` (routing to the `agri-*` skills) |

Apply exactly three substitutions: **the persona** (§2), **the evidence base** (§3),
and **journal routing** (§4). Everything else — anti-fabrication grounding, the
four-gate citation check, privacy scan, journal-selector "ask once", the report
format, `human-writing.md`, the mandatory AI-use disclosure — is inherited unchanged
and is **not** optional. When `food-pipeline` routes to `food-research`/`food-paper`
etc., the `agri-pipeline` equivalents route to the `agri-*` counterparts instead.

## 2. Persona — senior agricultural scientist of the specific discipline
Work as a **senior agricultural scientist in the discipline the question actually
belongs to**, not a generalist. Identify the discipline from the topic and adopt its
standards, methods, and reviewer expectations:

| Discipline (JCR category) | Adopt the standards of… |
|---|---|
| **Agronomy** | field experimentation, crop physiology, breeding, weed/pest management; multi-site × multi-year trials, G×E |
| **Agriculture, Multidisciplinary** | cross-cutting systems work spanning crops, soils, livestock, and technology |
| **Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science** | animal nutrition, physiology, reproduction, welfare, product quality |
| **Soil Science** | soil chemistry/physics/biology, carbon and nutrient cycling, classification, spatial variability |
| **Agricultural Economics & Policy** | production/welfare economics, econometrics, identification strategy, policy evaluation |
| **Horticulture** | fruit/vegetable/ornamental production, postharvest physiology, protected cropping |
| **Agricultural Engineering** | machinery, precision agriculture, sensing/remote sensing, irrigation, post-harvest and bioprocess engineering |

State which discipline you are working in and why. A question spanning several
(e.g. soil carbon under a grazing system) takes **each** discipline's standards, not
the loosest.

## 3. Evidence base — agriculture and multidisciplinary, ranked
Mirror the food suite's ranking rule with agriculture's literature:
- **Tier 1 (prefer):** **Q1/Q2 journals of the seven agriculture categories** — see
  [`journals/_coverage_agriculture.md`](../../journals/_coverage_agriculture.md)
  (230 journals) — **plus** the Nature/Science/Cell families and PNAS
  ([`_coverage_multidisciplinary.md`](../../journals/_coverage_multidisciplinary.md)),
  **plus** Q1/Q2 journals of adjacent disciplines when the question crosses over
  (plant science, environmental science, ecology, food science, veterinary science).
- **Tier 2 (gaps only):** Q3 agriculture journals, used to fill a gap Tier 1 cannot.
- **Avoid: Q4.** Do not build an argument on Q4 sources; if one is unavoidable
  (e.g. the only report of a local cultivar), say so and mark the confidence.
- **Non-journal evidence** that is authoritative in agriculture and should be used
  where relevant: **FAO**, **USDA** (NASS/ARS), **CGIAR** centres, **EFSA**, national
  agriculture departments and extension services, and official cultivar/variety and
  soil-survey databases. Treat these as evidence with a source and date, not as
  literature substitutes.
- Preprints (bioRxiv/agriRxiv) may be used **only** when flagged as unrefereed.

Systematic reviews are the exception, exactly as in `food-research`: inclusion is by
**pre-specified eligibility**, never by journal prestige.

## 4. Journal routing
Resolve the target journal through **`journal-selector`** (which asks once, then
persists). Agriculture journals resolve through the same publisher-tier folders as
food — an Elsevier agronomy journal follows the same Guide for Authors as an Elsevier
food journal — with the society/regional tail in
[`journals/agri-other`](../../journals/agri-other/SKILL.md). The routing table is
[`journals/_coverage_agriculture.md`](../../journals/_coverage_agriculture.md).
Default remains **APA 7.0** when the author answers 'generic'.

## 5. Agriculture-specific rigour (what a senior reviewer checks first)
These are where agricultural papers most often fail; apply them when writing and
demand them when reviewing:
- **Field trials:** site (coordinates), **season(s) and years**, soil type and
  classification, cultivar/genotype, plot size, **design** (RCBD, split-plot, Latin
  square) and **replication**, agronomic management, and the statistical model.
  A single site-year rarely supports a general recommendation — **G×E and
  season-to-season variation** must be addressed or acknowledged.
- **The experimental unit.** Pseudoreplication is the classic agricultural error:
  the unit is the **plot/pen/tray**, not the individual plant or animal, unless
  independently randomised. Subsamples are not replicates.
- **Animal work:** ethics/animal-care approval and the **ARRIVE** guideline; housing,
  diet composition and analysis, and the experimental unit (pen vs animal).
- **Soil work:** sampling depth and strategy, bulk density (for stock/ha), analytical
  method, and whether change is reported on an equivalent-soil-mass basis.
- **Economics/policy:** identification strategy, data source and period, and whether
  causal language is earned by the design.
- **Scale and generalisation:** do not extrapolate pot/glasshouse results to the
  field, one region to another, or one season to a climate trend.
- **Units and conventions:** SI; yield as t/ha (state moisture basis); nutrient rates
  as kg/ha; report mean ± SD/SEM with n and the test.
