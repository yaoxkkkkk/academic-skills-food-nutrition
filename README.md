# Academic Skills for Food & Nutrition Science

Original, **MIT-licensed** Claude Code skills for the food & nutrition research
lifecycle — **research → write → review → revise** — with built-in knowledge of
food-science journal author guidelines and a food-science figure workflow.

Open source. Free to use, modify, and build on.

## Skills

### Core workflow
- **`food-research`** — comprehensive, multi-source literature discovery and
  evidence synthesis for food & nutrition (FSTA, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus,
  AGRICOLA, preprints, semantic search; EFSA/FDA/USDA/Codex for safety and
  regulatory evidence). Four-layer search, two-phase screening, and synthesis via
  subagents; grades evidence and maps gaps. Four streams — **quick brief, full
  review, deep research, systematic**. The first three **prioritize sources by
  journal ranking** (`journal_ranker`: Q1/Q2 food-science & nutrition, plus
  Nature/Science/Cell families and Q1/Q2 in any other discipline = highest
  priority; Q3 second; Q4 avoided). Includes a **PRISMA 2020 systematic review**
  mode (`systematic_reviewer` + `data_extractor`), which uses eligibility-based
  inclusion rather than journal ranking.
- **`deep-research`** — source-validated literature-review engine (scope → design
  → discover → **screen by journal ranking** → **validate every source** →
  extract & verify evidence → synthesize → stress-test → **write & format** →
  editorial + integrity review loop) with a 12-subagent team. Outputs a finished,
  formatted review (**APA 7.0** by default, or a target journal's style via
  `journal-selector`). Runs standalone or as `food-research`'s deep-dive engine.
- **`food-paper`** — journal-aware manuscript writing. Resolves the target
  journal first, drafts to its structure and limits, applies its reference
  style, and routes figures through `food-figure`.
- **`food-review`** — referee-perspective peer review (methodology,
  statistics, novelty/scope, plus food-safety/ethics) with an editor decision.
- **`food-pipeline`** — orchestrates the whole path from topic/data to a
  submission-ready manuscript, with journal selection up front.

### Journal knowledge
- **`journal-selector`** — asks which journal you're targeting (or reads it from
  your request) and loads that journal's constraints. Covers **60 journals**
  (see [`journals/_coverage.md`](journals/_coverage.md)).
- **`journals/*`** — 16 publisher-tiered author-guideline skills (Elsevier,
  Wiley, Nature Portfolio, Springer, Taylor & Francis, MDPI, RSC, ACS, Annual
  Reviews, Oxford, Emerald, KeAi/Tsinghua, Codon, BioMed Central). Each lists the
  journals it covers, their limits, structure, **reference/citation style**, and
  a submission checklist.

### Figures
- **`food-figure`** — submission-grade food-science figures in Python or R
  (grouped bars with error bars and significance letters, sensory radar,
  microbial growth/survival curves, chromatograms, texture profile analysis,
  rheology, PCA/heatmaps, microscopy), exporting journal-ready SVG/PDF/TIFF at
  the target journal's spec.

## How it fits together

Name a journal ("I want to publish on Food Chemistry" / "format for LWT") and
`journal-selector` loads that journal's rules; `food-paper` writes to them and
re-flows the reference list into the journal's citation style; any figure
request goes to `food-figure` at the journal's DPI and column width. Ask for the
whole thing and `food-pipeline` runs research → write → review → revise with
checkpoints.

## Coverage

All 60 target journals map to a publisher-tiered skill, verified by
[`scripts/check_journal_coverage.py`](scripts/check_journal_coverage.py). Full
map: [`journals/_coverage.md`](journals/_coverage.md).

Author-guideline details record a `Source:` URL and a `Verified:` date. Publisher
pages change and several block automated access — confirm exact numeric limits at
the source before submitting; structure and reference styles are the stable part.

This is original, independently written work released under MIT. It was informed
by — but contains no code or text from — earlier community projects exploring
academic-research and scientific-figure skills for Claude Code, including the
`nature-skills` collection (Apache-2.0), `deer-flow` (MIT), and
`academic-research-skills` (CC-BY-NC-4.0). Only non-copyrightable workflow
*concepts* (e.g. multi-source search, layered retrieval, staged screening,
parallel extraction, PRISMA structure, subagent teams) were drawn on; all wording
