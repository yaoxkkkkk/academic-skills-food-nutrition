name: journal-selector
description: "Resolve a target food/nutrition journal to its author-guideline skill and formatting constraints. Use at the start of writing, formatting, or submission-prep for a food-science paper, and whenever the user names a journal they want to publish in or format their manuscript for, to load that journal's rules (word/abstract limits, structure, reference/citation style, figure spec). Triggers: which journal, target journal, publish on a journal, publish in a journal, I want to publish on Food Chemistry, submit to LWT, format for a journal, format my manuscript for a named journal, edit the manuscript based on a journal's style, journal style, journal reference style, journal citation style, submission guidelines, prepare for submission, pick a journal."

# Journal Selector — Route a Manuscript to Its Journal Skill

Maps a target journal to the correct `journals/<folder>` author-guideline skill
and returns its `## Formatting constraints`. Authoritative mappings:
[food (60)](../journals/_coverage.md) ·
[nutrition (59)](../journals/_coverage_nutrition.md) ·
[multidisciplinary (35)](../journals/_coverage_multidisciplinary.md) ·
[**agriculture Q1+Q2 (230)**](../journals/_coverage_agriculture.md).

## Behavior

1. **Determine the target journal — ask once.** If the author has already named a
   journal (full name or JCR abbreviation), resolve it. If a target journal is
   **already on record for this project/session** (resolved earlier, or set by
   `food-pipeline`), reuse it and skip the question. Otherwise **ask exactly once**:
   > "Which journal are you targeting? (name or JCR abbreviation — e.g. Food
   > Chemistry, LWT, Nature Food). If undecided, say 'generic' and I'll use
   > standard food-science conventions."
2. **Resolve** the journal to its skill folder using the alias table below (or
   `journals/_coverage.md`). Match case-insensitively on full name or abbreviation.
3. **Load** `journals/<folder>/SKILL.md` and return its `## Formatting constraints`
   block plus the checklist. Note any per-journal override row in that skill's
   "Applies to" table (limits can differ within a publisher group).
4. **Hand off:** the calling pipeline applies these constraints to structure,
   word/abstract limits, and reference style, and passes `figure_dpi` /
   `column_widths_*` to the `food-figure` skill.
5. **If 'generic' or unresolved:** use standard food-science conventions
   (IMRaD; abstract ≤250 words; numbered or author–date references; figures
   ≥300 dpi; ~90/190 mm columns) and state the assumption so the author can
   correct it.

## Ask once, then persist
The journal question is asked **at most once per project**. Once resolved (to a
journal *or* to 'generic'/APA 7.0), **record the choice and its constraints** and
reuse them for every downstream stage and subagent — never re-prompt. Re-run this
resolution **only** when the user explicitly asks to target a **different**
journal; then replace the recorded choice and re-flow the affected formatting
(structure, limits, reference style, figure spec).

### Multidisciplinary & cross-discipline journals
High-priority venues food/nutrition researchers publish in, grouped by publisher
format (the Nature/Science/Cell families and PNAS are top-priority per the
ranking rule).

## Output contract
Return: `{journal, publisher, skill_folder, reference_style, abstract_words,
figure_spec, notes}` drawn from the resolved skill's constraints block, so the
paper pipeline and `food-figure` can consume it directly.
