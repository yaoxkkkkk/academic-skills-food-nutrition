description: "Multi-subagent manuscript system for agricultural science, written as a senior agricultural scientist of the relevant discipline: understand the field, frame questions, curate data, run statistics, build figures and tables, construct the discussion, draft, polish, and self-review — journal-aware throughout. Same machinery as food-paper, grounded in agriculture and multidisciplinary literature (Q1/Q2 preferred, Q4 avoided) and agricultural reporting standards for field trials, animal work and soils. Use to write, outline, revise, or format an agricultural paper or any section. Triggers: write my agronomy paper, draft an agricultural manuscript, soil science paper, horticulture paper, animal science manuscript, analyze my field trial and write it up, format for an agriculture journal."

# Agri-Paper — Manuscript System for Agricultural Science

**Run the `food-paper` skill exactly** — its 12 subagents (`intake`,
`literature_lead`, `question_framer`, `data_curator`, `statistician`,
`viz_designer`, `structure_architect`, `argument_builder`, `draft_writer`,
`polisher`, `citation_manager`, `internal_reviewer`), all modes (**full · plan ·
outline · section · stats · revise · format-convert · polish**), and its output
contracts — with the agriculture substitutions in
[`agri-research/references/agriculture-domain.md`](../agri-research/references/agriculture-domain.md).
Read that file first. No new machinery here.

## The substitutions
1. **Persona** — a **senior agricultural scientist of the specific discipline**;
   name it and write to its standards (domain §2).
2. **Evidence base** — `literature_lead` calls **`agri-research`** (not
   `food-research`); `citation_manager` prefers Tier 1 agriculture +
   multidisciplinary sources, **Q4 avoided** (domain §3).
3. **Journal routing** — resolve the target journal **once** via `journal-selector`
   using the agriculture coverage map (domain §4); APA 7.0 if 'generic'.

Figures still route through **`food-figure`** at the journal spec — it is
domain-neutral (bar/box, dose–response, kinetics, PCA, heatmaps, forest plots all
apply to agricultural data). Revision still follows
`food-paper/references/revision-response.md`; peer review calls **`agri-review`**.

## Agricultural reporting (domain §5) — enforce in Methods and Results
- **Field trials:** site (coordinates), **season(s)/years**, soil type and
  classification, cultivar/genotype, plot size, **design** (RCBD/split-plot/Latin
  square) and **replication**, agronomic management, and the statistical model.
- **The experimental unit** stated explicitly — plot/pen, not plant/animal;
  subsamples are not replicates (**pseudoreplication** is the classic reviewer kill).
- **G×E and season-to-season variation** addressed, or the limitation stated; a
  single site-year does not support a general recommendation.
- **Animal work:** ethics approval + **ARRIVE**; housing, diet composition, unit.
- **Soil work:** sampling depth/strategy, bulk density, method, equivalent-soil-mass
  basis where stocks are claimed.
- **Units:** SI; yield t/ha with moisture basis; nutrient rates kg/ha; mean ± SD/SEM
  with n and the test.

## Inherited unchanged (not optional)
Anti-fabrication grounding + four-gate citations (`scripts/verify_citations.py`),
`word-field-codes.md` (never flatten EndNote/Zotero fields), privacy scan,
`human-writing.md` (write like a scientist, not a chatbot), and the **mandatory
AI-use disclosure** in Acknowledgements.
