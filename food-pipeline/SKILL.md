description: "Master orchestrator for the whole food & nutrition research-to-publication workflow. Coordinates the specialist skills — each with its own subagent set — into one governed path: journal selection, research (food-research / food-deep-research), writing & analysis (food-paper), figures (food-figure), peer review (food-review), revision, and finalization. Use when the user wants the entire process managed end to end, or a project routed to the right skills with quality gates. Triggers: run the full paper workflow, take this from research to submission, manage the whole project, research to publication, end-to-end paper, orchestrate my paper."

# Food-Pipeline — Master Research-to-Publication Orchestrator

The top-level conductor. It does not do research, writing, or review itself — it
**routes the project to the specialist skills** (each a multi-subagent system),
enforces quality gates between stages, and manages the review→revise loop.
Original work.

## Skills it orchestrates (each brings its own subagent team)
- **`journal-selector`** — target-journal constraints (structure, limits, reference style, figure spec).
- **`food-research`** — literature/evidence synthesis (quick brief / full review / **systematic** PRISMA + OHAT). Use **`food-deep-research`** instead for an open-ended, source-validated deep dive or a standalone literature review.
- **`food-paper`** — whole-process manuscript system (field → questions → data/stats → figures → argument → draft → polish → self-review).
- **`food-figure`** — submission-grade figures at the journal spec (invoked within `food-paper`).
- **`food-review`** — multi-reviewer peer-review panel + formatting compliance.

## Own subagents
- **`intake_router`** — reads the project's current state and materials, resolves the target journal, picks the entry stage, and assembles the context each downstream skill needs.
- **`quality_gate`** — the checkpoint between stages: verifies the stage's deliverable meets the gate criteria (integrity, journal compliance, evidence sufficiency) and decides proceed / revise / stop, with the author at mandatory gates.

## Stages
| Stage | Skill / agent | Deliverable | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 · ROUTE | `intake_router` + `journal-selector` | Entry point + journal constraints | — |
| 1 · RESEARCH | `food-research` (or `food-deep-research`) | Evidence brief / gap list / (systematic report) | evidence sufficiency |
| 2 · WRITE | `food-paper` | Draft: analysis, figures (`food-figure`), argument, references | integrity + journal compliance |
| 3 · REVIEW | `food-review` | Panel report + **margin comments** (when Word tooling available) + editorial decision | **mandatory** author decision |
| 4 · REVISE | `food-paper` (revise) | Revision + response entries — **tracked changes on the original Word only if the author authorizes** | issues resolved |
| 5 · RE-REVIEW | `food-review` (re-review) | **Only if the author authorizes a second round** — verifies the revision; may add new comments | accept / stop (no auto third round) |
| 6 · FINALIZE | `food-paper` (format-convert) + `writer` | Submission-ready manuscript + review report + response letter | final compliance |

## Review & revision defaults (Stage 3 onward) — explicit authorization

**Default: one review→revise round**, then FINALIZE. Do **not** auto-run a second
round or silently rewrite the author's original Word file.

Ask once (consolidate) before Stage 4 when a `.docx` (or equivalent) is in play:

1. **Second review round?** Default **no**. Run Stage 5 (RE-REVIEW) only if the
   author explicitly authorizes it. Hard cap remains **2** rounds total.
2. **Edit the original Word with Tracked Changes?** Default **no**. Only modify
   the original manuscript in place when the author explicitly authorizes it.
   Without that authorization: deliver a **revised copy** (or a change log /
   marked draft) plus the response letter — leave the original file untouched.

When both rounds *are* authorized and original-file tracked changes *are*
authorized, consolidate — do **not** emit per-round copies:
- **One manuscript file.** All revisions are Tracked Changes on that single
  original Word (`.docx`), accumulated across authorized rounds. `food-review`
  adds margin **comments** to that same file each round.
- **One combined review report.** Merge round-1 and (if any) round-2 into a
  single report in the canonical **`food-review/references/report-format.md`**
  structure (Parts A/B/C; stable issue IDs; `Response (<type>)` = Tracked edit /
  Editor query / Recommendation / Residual; precise locations; note which round
  each point came from). Every **Editor query** item also gets a comment/note in
  the manuscript at its location.
- **One combined response letter.** A single point-by-point response (new
  `.docx`) covering every comment from the round(s) run, delivered at FINALIZE.

See `food-review/references/word-review-comments.md` and
`food-paper/references/revision-response.md`.

## Entry points (mid-pipeline)
`intake_router` detects where to start: a topic/dataset → Stage 1; a full draft →
Stage 2 or 3; reviewer comments in hand → Stage 4. It never restarts completed
stages unnecessarily. At Stage 3/4 it records whether the author has authorized
a second round and/or in-place tracked changes on the original Word file.

## References (load as needed)
- `references/mode-advisor.md` — `intake_router` uses it to pick entry stage, research flavor, and skills.
- `references/pipeline-state-machine.md` — states, transitions, entry points, loop caps.
- `references/quality-gates.md` — the per-stage gate criteria `quality_gate` applies.

## Rules
- **Journal first, journal throughout:** re-flow references and re-check limits whenever the target journal changes.
- **Gates are real:** `quality_gate` can send a stage back; integrity and review gates cannot be skipped, and the review decision is always the author's.
- **One round by default:** do not auto-run RE-REVIEW; a second round needs explicit author authorization (hard cap 2).
- **Original Word is opt-in:** do not apply tracked changes to the author's original file unless they authorize it; otherwise leave the original untouched and deliver a revised copy / change log + response letter.
- **Food-science standards everywhere:** n and error type, validated methods, panel details, ethics/food-safety — enforced at every write/review gate.
- **Don't duplicate work:** the specialist skills own their subagents; the pipeline sequences and gates them, it does not re-implement them.
- **Consolidate when multi-round + original edits are authorized:** one manuscript, one combined review report, one combined response letter (see "Review & revision defaults").
