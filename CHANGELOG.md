# Changelog

## 1.6.0 — 2026-07

- `food-review` rebuilt into a multi-reviewer panel: `review_coordinator`
  (editor-in-chief), `reviewer_methodology`, `reviewer_domain`,
  `reviewer_integrity`, `devils_advocate`, and `format_checker` (formatting/
  reference-style compliance vs the target journal — APA 7.0 default, or a
  specific journal via `journal-selector`). Outputs an editorial decision +
  revision checklist + response-letter skeleton.
- Journal coverage extended to the **Nutrition & Dietetics** journal list,
  grouped by publisher format alongside food: existing publisher skills
  (Elsevier, Wiley, Springer, Taylor & Francis, MDPI, Annual Reviews, BMC,
  Oxford) now list their nutrition journals, and three new skills were added —
  `cambridge-nutrition`, `frontiers-nutrition`, and `nutrition-other` (niche
  publishers). New `journals/_coverage_nutrition.md` map + checker update.

## 1.5.0 — 2026-07

- `food-research` **systematic** stream rebuilt into a full PRISMA pipeline with
  new subagents: `sr_search` (≥3 databases — Web of Science/Scopus/PubMed —
  combine + dedupe), `sr_screener` (two independent instances, three steps:
  title → abstract → full text), `sr_moderator` (compares the two screeners at
  each step and resolves conflicts), `risk_of_bias` (**OHAT** for in vitro /
  human / animal, 11 questions × 6 domains × 4-point scale), and `sr_synthesis`
  (PRISMA description → bias results → per-research-question synthesis). Clearer
  activation conditions for when to use systematic vs full review.
- New shared `writer` (writes the manuscript and exports **Word .docx**, APA 7.0
  or target-journal style via `journal-selector`) and `reviewer` (combined
  editorial + integrity review with a revision loop). The **full review** and
  **systematic** streams now both end in a reviewed Word manuscript.
- `data_extractor` now produces a results table organized by research question
  from the final shortlist.

## 1.4.0 — 2026-07

- `deep-research` rebuilt into a source-validated **literature-review** engine
  (12 subagents): `research_scope` (comprehensive scoping), `research_architect`
  (methodology blueprint), `investigator` (two-pass discovery + evidence),
  `source_screener` (journal-ranking tiers, reusing the food-research priority
  data), `source_verifier` (existence/venue/retraction/predatory/COI → Source
  Quality Matrix), `bibliography` (dedupe + APA 7.0 / target-journal formatting
  via `journal-selector`), `claim_verifier`, an expanded `synthesizer`, `critic`,
  `compiler` (writes & formats the review), and `editor` + `ethics_reviewer` with
  a compile↔review polish loop. Evidence is drawn only from validated sources.
- `food-research`: clarified the quick brief and full review streams with
  explicit invocation phrases and the exact subagent call sequence for each.

## 1.3.0 — 2026-07

- `food-research`: new **`journal_ranker`** subagent that prioritizes sources by
  journal ranking (Q1/Q2 food-science & nutrition, Nature/Science/Cell families,
  and Q1/Q2 in any other discipline = highest; Q3 second; Q4 avoided), backed by
  `references/journal-priority.csv` (JCR quartiles for Food Science & Technology
  and Nutrition & Dietetics). Applied to the quick brief, full review, and deep
  research streams — **not** to systematic review (eligibility-based inclusion).
- Clarified `food-research` into four named streams (quick brief / full review /
  deep research / systematic) with when-to-use guidance and a workflow flowchart.
- Added workflow flowcharts to `food-research` and the `systematic_reviewer`
  subagent.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-07

- New **`deep-research`** skill: general iterative deep-research engine (scope →
  plan → investigate → verify → synthesize → critique → report) with a 6-subagent
  team (`question_scoper`, `research_planner`, `investigator`, `verifier`,
  `synthesizer`, `critic`). Runs standalone or as `food-research`'s deep-dive engine.
- `food-research` gains a **PRISMA 2020 systematic-review** capability: new
  `systematic_reviewer` (protocol → search → PRISMA flow → extraction →
  risk-of-bias → synthesis ± meta-analysis) and `data_extractor` (parallel,
  batched structured extraction) subagents; `systematic` mode now routes to them.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-07

- `food-research` expanded to a comprehensive, multi-source workflow: four-layer
  search (structured → backward chaining → forward chaining → semantic),
  two-phase screening with a food-science quality rubric, and cross-source
  synthesis with an evidence matrix, evidence grading, coverage advisory, and gap
  analysis. MCP-tool-aware (PubMed, Consensus, bioRxiv, CrossRef, …) with web
  fallback.
- Added four `food-research` subagents: `search_strategist`, `source_scout`,
  `screener_appraiser`, `synthesis`.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-07

First open-source release. Original, MIT-licensed work.

### Skills
- Core workflow: `food-research`, `food-paper` (journal-aware), `food-review`,
  `food-pipeline`.
- `journal-selector` + 16 publisher-tiered journal author-guideline skills under
  `journals/` covering 60 food & nutrition journals
  (see `journals/_coverage.md`).
- `food-figure`: food-science figure workflow (Python or R; journal-ready
  SVG/PDF/TIFF).

### Notes
- Every skill's body and description is in English.
- Journal skills capture each journal's reference/citation style; `food-paper`
  re-flows references to the target journal's style.
- Coverage of all 60 journals verified by `scripts/check_journal_coverage.py`.
